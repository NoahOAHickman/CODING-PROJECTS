// For my version of the Mixed Messages Codecademy project, I'm going to create 
// a bad advice generator. It's just going to dole out bad, randomly generated advice to the user. 
// it will output a format string with 3 peices of data in it, all randomly selected from a list of words
// I will also include a 'Name your firstborn child ${literalRandomLetters}', because why not have a 
// legitimately randomly generated portion in there?
